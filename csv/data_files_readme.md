### General Info
These are pipe delimited files instead of true CSV, as the comma character appears often in the tweet text itself.

The column headers are as follows:

`Tweet ID | Tweet Permalink | Username | Text | Date`

### Filename
The geolocation information is not included as it was blank for all tweets retrieded. Just create a Point on the location in the filename.

The filename is laid out as city-state-dateFrom-to-dateTo.txt.
